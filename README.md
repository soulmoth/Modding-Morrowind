# Modding-Morrowind

Basic version control repository for my growing mod fascination with Morrowind - if you see any glaring errors in how I'm going about this,
please let me know as I am a total noob when it comes to VC and modding in general.

My plan is to follow the modlist here, and install all or most of them.

Great site, and thank you so much for putting it up!
